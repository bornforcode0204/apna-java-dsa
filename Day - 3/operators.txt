Operators in Java: 
    Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operation.

    sum = a(operand) +(Operator) b(operand)

    1. Arithmetic Operators (Binary/Unary)
    2. Relational Operators
    3. Logical Operators
    4. Bitwise Operators
    5. Assignment Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators (Binary/Unary):

Binary              Unary
+                     ++(pre-increment/post-increment)
-                     --(pre-decrement/post-decrement)
*
/
%

2. Relational Operators

    == equal
    != not equal to (inequality)
    > grater than
    < less than 
    >= grater than equal to
    <= less than equal to

3. Logical Operators

    && (Logical AND) -> ture when both condition are true otherwise false
    || (Logical OR) -> false when both condition are false otherwise true
    !   (Logical NOT) -> It reverse T->F, F->T



5. Assignment Operators

    =
    +=
    -=
    *=
    /=
